# Complement to Columbus7 documentation
Columbus7 originates in 1980s and preserves many historical codes. Besides, the user community of Columbus7 is always small. As a result, there are compatibility issues and undiscovered bugs, which are out of the coverage of the official documentation

## Installation
Steps
1. Install a Global Arrays
2. Enter a desired directory, tar -xzvf the installation package
3. export COLUMBUS=(current directory)/Columbus
4. cp Path_To_Global_Arrays/lib/*.a $Columbus
5. vi install.config. If the last line(s) = cpan || standard || grad || parallel, then delete these line(s). Repeat this operation each time before ./install.automatic
6. ./install.automatic cpan standard grad
7. ./install.automatic parallel

Solutions to some issues
* Global Arrays (subsequently Columbus7) does not support mpi 3.0 standard, e.g. openmpi 4 fails but 3 works
* Installation may fail with intel mpi. For now openmpi always works
* Replace certain files with their counterparts in Modification

## Basis set
Linear dependency will not be excluded automatically, so user has to take care of that

To define customized basis beyond `colinp`, user has to manually modify `daltaoin` and `infofl`

`daltaoin` specifies the GTOs and the contractions, whose format is:
1. (s for spherical basis, c for Cartesian basis), type of atoms, unknown flag, unknown flag
2. Atom number, number of this type of atoms, number of l types, number of s orbitals, number of p orbitals, ...
3. Atom coordinate
4. H marking the head of a basis, number of alphas, number of contracted basis. Basis are sorted by l
5. Alpha value, contraction coefficients

`infofl` contains the number of basis in each irreducible representation

## MCSCF
MCSCF is a nonlinear optimization problem, so may easily be trapped into local minimum, e.g.:
* Molecular orbital may lose symmetry if not explicitly using symmetry (although this may also arise from intruder states)
* Even the molecular orbitals have correct symmetry, the calculation without symmetry may give a higher energy

Never freeze mcscf orbitals, otherwise the Hamiltonian matrix elements are erroneous

Tighten MCSCF tolerance in mcscfin before running MRCI, recommend:
* gradient (W) norm < tol(2)=1e-8
* orbital correction (K) norm < tol(3)=1e-8

## MRCI
The upper limit of CI expansion on a 24 CPU 128 GB memory computer in 2020 is ~ 240,000,000

To run parallel MRCI:
* you may have to manually change the 'ciudg' keyword in control.run to 'pciudg'
* modify nseg in ciudgin according to WORK/ciudg.perf to speed up

Tighten MRCI tolerance in ciudgin before computing gradient, recommend:
* RTOLCI = 1e-5

Tighten MRCI gradient tolerance in cigrdin:
* orbital resolution < wndtol = 1e-9, wnatol = 1e-9, wnvtol = 1e-9
* final effective densitymatrix < ftol = 1e-11
* if using LAPACK solver (no symmetry): solvelpck = 1, mdir = 0, cdir = 0; else Columbus solver (with symmetry): nmiter = 200, nvrsmx = 200, rtol = 1e-10, dtol = 1e-10

## Geometry optimization

### Minimum and more
`gdiis.x` takes initial Hessian from:
1. WORK/hessianinv, for `bfgs`
2. hessian, for `bfgs` and `sadd`
3. intcfl, for `bfgs` and `sadd` and `coni`

Only `bfgs` updates Hessian by BFGS method, others keep using initial Hessian

### Saddle point
No one has ever tried RGF, since `gdiis.x` works well

### Minimum energy crossing
There are 2 steps:
1. To find a conical intersection seam
2. To minimize energy on the seam

`gdiis.x` is only implemented to search for degeneracy rather than minimum energy crossing. So we stick to `polyhess.x`

`polyhess.x` uses Lagrange multiplier + naive Newton iteration + BFGS Hessian update, so the initial guess has to be really close

WORK/h-pieces and WORK/continuity are the files to continue `polyhess.x` iteration

polyhesin to approach degenerate seam:
* &NACINT{maxit=200,newton=1,iheseq1=1,ihess=0,ipflg=3,accel=1,scale=0.1,kscale=0}/end
* This is actually steepest descent (always use unit Hessian), with `learning rate = scale`
* So there is no need to continue with WORK/h-pieces
* Cris recommends not to continue with WORK/continuity as well

polyhesin to start minimizing energy on the seam (building Hessian):
* &NACINT{maxit=200,newton=1,iheseq1=-1,methodn=99*-1,ihess=0,ipflg=3,accel=1,scale=0.1,kscale=0,}/end
* The difference to Newton iteration is learning rate = scale < 1

polyhesin to end search:
* &NACINT{maxit=200,newton=1,iheseq1=-1,methodn=99*-1,ihess=0,ipflg=3,accel=1,scale=1.0,kscale=2,}/end
* This is Newton iteration

## Issue
Installation
* ifort 2018.3 with avx2 leads to bug in mcscf.x

Interactive input (colinp)
* In CI input, display bug occurs for font size > 12
* In hessian input, perl bug occurs for font size > 8

Redundant input files generated by colinp
* infofl.*: when they are the same to infofl
* daltcomm.new: when it is the same to daltcomm

MCSCF
* Energies may differ by 1e-6 Hatree from calculations with or without symmetry (although the molecular orbitals look the same)
* The molecular orbitals converged by higher symmetry may not converge at the 1st iteration in lower symmetry

MRCI
* Switching orbital ordering in `cidrtin` would give different number of CSFs, although the energies seem to be the same
* Increase `maxbl` in `cisrtin` (usually to 200000), otherwise "maxbl too small" exception may be raised
* Frozen virtual is not supported in `cigrd.x`

Gradient
* If specifying 'cigrad' in control.run, then runc assumes geometry optimization job, so gdiisin is required
* If specifying 'cigrad' in control.run, then cigrdin cannot contain 'nadcalc'
* If specifying 'nadcoupl' in control.run, then sometimes calculating only energy gradients without nonadiabatic couplings would make cigrd.x raise inconsistent-energy error (probably buggy density matrix)

## Flags that do not have to be tuned
Numerical accuracy:
* integral accuracy in `daltaoin`
* AO-MO transformation accuracy in `tranin`

Numerical stability:
* `FRCSUB` in `ciudgin` (if you want to tune it, check AO linear dependency first)
