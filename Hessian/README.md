# Hessian

To calculate Hessian:
1. Follow official documentation instruction until 'Output analysis'
2. `python3 forceconst.py` (Yes, it is the official forceconst.pl that is buggy)

Analyze the vibration by `python3 vibration.py`

Optionally, generate a scan along a normal mode by `python3 normscan.py`
