# Potential energy surface (PES)

## Prepare appended geometry file
`cartscan.py` generates a scan along 1 or 2 cartesian direction(s)

`intscan.py` generates a scan along 1 or 2 internal direction(s)

`cartpath.py` generates a Cartesian coordinate linear synchronous transit path between 2 geometries

`intpath.py` generates an internal coordinate linear synchronous transit path between 2 geometries

## Process data
`filter.py` filters the information in geom data to suit SurfGen format

`merge.py` merges the loops along a path into a path
